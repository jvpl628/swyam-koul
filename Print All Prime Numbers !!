Problem Statement

Alex, a passionate math student, loves exploring number patterns. One day, while studying prime numbers, he decides to write a program that prints all prime numbers within a given range.

Your task is to help Alex by writing a program that uses functions to print all prime numbers between two given integers (inclusive).

You must define and use a function to check whether a number is prime or not, and then use that function to display all prime numbers within the interval.

Input Format

The first line contains two integers — start and end, representing the range (inclusive).
Constraints

1 ≤ start ≤end ≤ 10000
Output Format

Print all prime numbers between start and end separated by spaces.
If no prime number exists in the given interval, print No prime numbers found.
Sample Input 0

10 30
Sample Output 0

11 13 17 19 23 29
